Do we talk about MPC ?

What computing needs to be done ?




=> Create example of simple multi-objective
	f_1 : calculate the travel time of the vehicle
		eval function :
			1- original position : t=0,x=0
			2- density around vehicle = density of closer cell for t
			3- speed is given by the fundamental diagram of that cell 
				-freeflow speed v if dens < critic_dens
				- else : v - w * (dens - critic_dens)

			4- next position : t+dt, x+speed*dt
			5- as long as x< x_max and t < t_max, back to step 2
			6- if t < tmax => return t, else t_max too small
		gradient function :
			0 if not the density of a cell
			0 if the value of the cell is not used by the eval function
			0 if the cell was in freeflow
			-w else


	f_2 : opposite of travel time of vehicles behind the first one
	f_3 : opposite gradient of speed behind vehicle (vehicles behind must be slowed as quick as possible)
	f_4 : total travel time (to not be detected)
